Cloud computing has gained popularity in recent years delivering
various services as cost-effective platforms. However, the increasing
energy consumption needs to be addressed in order to preserve the
cost-effectiveness of these systems. In this work, we target the
storage infrastructure in a cloud system and introduce several energy
efficient storage node allocation methods by exploiting the metadata
heterogeneity of cloud users. Our proposed methods preserve load balance
on demand and switch inactive nodes into low-energy modes to save energy.
We provide a mathematical model to estimate the outcome of proposed methods
and conduct theoretical and simulative analyses using real-world workloads.
