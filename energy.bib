    abstract = {Data centers are the backend for a large number of
              services that we take for granted today. A
              significant fraction of the total cost of
              ownership of these large-scale storage systems is
              the cost of keeping hundreds of thousands of disks
              spinning. We present a simple idea that allows the
              storage system to turn off a large fraction of its
              disks, without incurring unacceptable performance
              penalties. Of particular appeal is the fact that
              our solution is not application-specific, and
              offers power-savings for a very generic data
              center model. In this paper, we describe our
              solution, identify the parameters that determine
              its cost-benefit tradeoffs, and present a
              simulator that allows us to explore this parameter
              space. We also present some initial simulation
              results that add weight to our claim that our
              solution represents a new powersaving opportunity
              for large-scale storage systems.},
